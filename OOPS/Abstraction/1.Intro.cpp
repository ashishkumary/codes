/*
=> Data Abstraction is a process of providing only the essential details to the
outside world and hiding the internal details, i.e., representing only the
essential details in the program.


=> In C++ program if we implement class with private and public members then it
is an example of data abstraction.



=> Data Abstraction can be achieved in two ways:

1.Abstraction in header files:
                               For example, pow() function available is used to
calculate the power of a number without actually knowing which algorithm
function uses to calculate the power. Thus, we can say that header files hides
all the implementation details from the user.


2.Abstraction using classes:
                             An abstraction can be achieved using classes. A
class is used to group all the data members and member functions into a single
unit by using the access specifiers. A class has the responsibility to determine
which data member is to be visible outside and which is not.
