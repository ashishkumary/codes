/*Advantages Of Abstraction:

Implementation details of the class are protected from the inadvertent user level errors.
  
A programmer does not need to write the low level code.
  
Data Abstraction avoids the code duplication, i.e., programmer does not have to undergo the same tasks every time to perform the similar operation.
  
The main aim of the data abstraction is to reuse the code and the proper partitioning of the code across the classes.
  
Internal implementation can be changed without affecting the user level code */
