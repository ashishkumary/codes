/*=> Abstraction is the process or method of gaining the information while encapsulation is the process or method to contain the information.

=> Abstraction is the method of hiding the unwanted information whereas encapsulation is a method to hide the data in a single entity or unit along with a method to protect information from outside.

Example:

Abstraction : you'll never buy a "device", but always buy something more specific : iPhone, GSII, Nokia 3310... Here, iPhone, GSII and N3310 are concrete things, device is abstract.

Encapsulation : you've got several devices, all of them have got a USB port. You don't know what kind of printed circuit there's back, you just have to know you'll be able to plug a USB cable into it.

Abstraction is a concept, which is allowed by encapsulation. 


You can do encapsulation without using abstraction, but if you wanna use some abstraction in your projects, you'll need encapsulation.
