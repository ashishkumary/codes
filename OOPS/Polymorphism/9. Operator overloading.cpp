/*
Operator overloading:

#We can overload operators by creating operator functions. 
#An operator function defines the operation that the overloaded operator will perform.

Syntax: returntype operator op(args)

Two ways to overload operator :
1.Non static member function
2.Global friend function( non member )
( for this you need to pass extra argument which will be object of class)
